      <p>The static was the only thing that felt warm in the deep freeze of the orbital station. I had been listening to it for three days, a gentle hiss that reminded me of rain on a tin roof back on Earth.</p>
      <p>They said the silence would be the hardest part. They were wrong. The silence is peaceful. It's the waiting that tears you apart.</p>
      <p>I adjusted the frequency dial, watching the green waveform dance across the monitor. A rhythmic spike. A heartbeat? No, just a pulsar, spinning its lonely ballet light-years away.</p>
      <p>"Station Alpha, do you copy?" I whispered, mostly to hear my own voice. The words hung in the recycled air, heavy and dead.</p>
      <p>Nothing but the hiss. The cosmic microwave background radiation, the echo of the Big Bang, whispering the secrets of creation into my tired ears. I leaned back, closing my eyes. Perhaps today was not the day for rescue. Perhaps today was simply another day to listen.</p>

      <p>Gravity is not just a force; it is a memory of where we belong. As we approached the singularity, the ship began to groan, the metal hull complaining against the tidal forces that sought to stretch us into spaghetti.</p>
      <p>Captain Miller looked at the viewscreen. The accretion disk was a blinding halo of gold and violet. Beautiful. Deadly.</p>
      <p>"Hold steady," she commanded, though her hands trembled slightly on the console. We weren't trying to escape. We were trying to see what lay beyond.</p>
      <p>Time began to dilate. A second on the clock took an hour of my heartbeat. I watched a drop of sweat fall from my brow, suspended in the air like a diamond satellite. We were crossing the threshold, the point of no return.</p>
